            "<strong>Atonix</strong> was a executor started by now ex-WeAreDevs member Soulzay/bennytrt. In may of 2022 after watching a 1_f0 tutorial. A while later WeAreDevs Members Whoman & eforcarl joined the team and made the logo, script hub, and a remake of the UI in WPF with more APIs.",
            "A newcomer to the scene by the name of Stredja Banan Joined and remade the UI in Winforms, styled after the then very popular Synapse X. A controversial decision was made, Nam3 joined the team and remade the whole of atonix up until v2.",
            "At some point JoeIsGod, a WeAreDevs member joined the team to make a Module (which didn't happen) and the project died, but was revived by Soulzay and also controversial member MTyler1. After a month, the project died once more and was discontinued somewhere in 2024."
